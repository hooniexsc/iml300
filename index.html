      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Hoonie/sketches/RX9qVmtjr">Error</a>
      
      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/youve-got-a-new-message">You've Got a New Message</a><br>
    My hypernarrative is about the case of the Korean Army Headquarters conducted a targeted investigation of LGBTQ soldiers in 2017. I made an HTML website that makes users feel like they are on a chat msg of a gay dating application and through the message they can experience what the victims had to confront. When the user chooses to not continue the conversation, the p5js graphics come out saying 'Stay Quiet'. It implies that LGBT soldiers inevitably have no choice but to hide their identity during military service. At the end of the page, the specific figures and the incident details are described with visual images.
      
      <h2>Project 3: Networked Justice</h2>
      <a href="https://hooniexsc.github.io/iml300/project-3/index.html">Do you want to become happier?</a><br>
        According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 21.0 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode. This number represented 8.4% of all U.S. adults. As much as people achieve their ambitious dreams and have a strong will, they also can be fragile and weak beings, especially in terms of mental health. I believe that self-care and finding small little happy things around are crucial to recovering from depression and being resilient. For my networked justice HTML project, I wanted to support people who are temporarily and chronically depressed as well as with mental illness. This website is designed to let people find accessible ways to  experience happiness which are working out, meditation, creating art, cooking, reading books, and calling their family members. While people explore different means of being happier, they would be able to find new ways to reduce and manage stress levels and build their resilience. This website also includes information on professional help to assist people who need urgent help.

    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
American Artist<br>
While technology company has been taking over the world, the black community has still been marginalized and often ignored. White cis male dominant companies made the ‘whiteness’ on a computer system a default. This underlaid separation between white and black reminds me of programming terminology such as master-slave and blacklists (reject list) versus whitelists (accept list). I like how American Artist visualizes the sharp critique of the paradox of race, power, and identity in the development of technology and alludes to the color of black portraying a creative and space-revealing color. Also, the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) interface story reminds me that how the coding world can be modified and rewrote in a diverse way to pursue certain functions and the efforts of developers to make better user experience.

Hito Steyerl<br>
Steyerl noted that low sharpness and resolution are the main characteristics of poor images as an example of Woody Allen’s film. The resolution differentiates each class of images. Because of the fact that images are getting uncertain during it is uploaded, downloaded, and re-edited, poor images become processing image rather than completed. They mention that as the neoliberal society accelerates, the experimental film has been marginalized and had to stay only in an archive. However, as the video can be played on online condition, the situation drastically changed. Non-commercial videos started to get reappeared on online platforms. At the same time, that video can be downloaded, edited, and privatized. They mentioned that poor images merge life and art and can be used to overcome class society.

Joy Buolamwini<br>
The algorithm bias in programming led the software not able to detect her face because the people who coded it hadn't taught it to identify a broad range of skin tones and facial structures. The speaker was working on the fight for it and bringing change into it. The presentation reminds me of the video of the hand dryer in a bathroom that was working on a white man's hand but not on a black man's hand. I thought it also can cause a severe issue when this algorithm technology is used in an official, and legal field.

Olivia Mckayla Ross<br>
Olivia Mckayla Ross, media artist, and programmer, proposes the term 'nonviolent creative code' to pay attention to the violence that can happen in every aspect of the act of coding which may keep us away from the Earth, from ourselves, and from each other. Olivia calls it into 5 different categories which are Honor the Land, Honor the Body, Honor the Small, Honor the People, and Honor the Exchange. Her readings give me a perspective of seeing coding with sustainability and non-violence. In Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TED talk, she suggests that a story with only one point of view can be misleading and violent for someone. There is a need for a story that reflects various views and overlaps.

Ari Melenciano<br>
Ari Melenciano is an artist and creative technologist who explores how various forms of design influence sentient experiences. Ari suggests that a design process has to be done by a team whose team must not consist of only somebody who is a designer but must consist of people from other disciplines. It includes, for example, historians, scientists, engineers, artists, and community members. This idea can be applied to economics with circular design as a substitution for the present design approach which pursues instant gratification and produces unrecyclable waste.  And she also emphasizes we should focus on ecologically centered design rather than human-centered design to bring multiple perspectives.

Christine Sun Kim<br>
Since Christine Sun Kim was born deaf, she thought that sound was not part of her life, however, she discovered the similarities between American Sign Language and music and start to explore a new approach to expressing sound from the perspective of those who are not able to hear. She suggests that just like one single key difference makes a change in the chord it works the same in American Sign Language. I was surprised by the fact that Christine takes music and sound to express her idea and its fluidity between mediums. She emphasizes that people should start thinking hard about what defines social currency to make a step to lead to a more inclusive society.
