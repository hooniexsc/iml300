                    <p> According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 21.0 million adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode. This number represented 8.4% of all U.S. adults. As much as people achieve their ambitious dreams and have a strong will, they also can be fragile and weak beings, especially in terms of mental health. I believe that self-care and finding small little happy things around are crucial to recovering from depression and being resilient. For my networked justice HTML project, I wanted to support people who are temporarily and chronically depressed as well as with mental illness. This website is designed to let people find accessible ways to  experience happiness which are working out, meditation, creating art, cooking, reading books, and calling their family members. While people explore different means of being happier, they would be able to find new ways to reduce and manage stress levels and build their resilience. This website also includes information on professional help to assist people who need urgent help.
